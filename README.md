Studying supervised learnings by building models from scatch.

The implementation of models is referenced by several others projects:

This is for self study/practice/school assignment :octocat: no profit for purpose!

Following instructions show you how to play with this repo:

## Environment setup
Make sure you have Python on your machine.
After you pull this repo, following commands helps you installing the required packages.

```
// virtual environment is recommended, but optional
$ virtualenv venv

(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Encoding images
Part of learning algorithms rely on encoding datas, instead of raw images. Let's encode the images first!
Before encoding, put your face images in nested directories: a secondary layer of directories which separate your images by **names**.
for example:

```
$ tree pk_dataset_test
pk_dataset_test/
├── keira_knightley
│   ├── 001.jpg
│   └── 002.jpg
└── natalie_portman
    ├── 001.jpg
    └── 002.jpg
```

no matter how many layers in upper directory, be aware to separate the files 

Next, encoding your images with flag `-i` for path of image directory, and `-e` the name of out encodings
```
$ python encode_faces.py -i $ROOT_DIRECTORY_OF_IMAGES -e $OUTPUT_NAME
// i.e. 
$ python encode_faces.py -i ./pk_dataset_test -e pk_test.pickle
```

## Run algorithms

This program covers five algorithms. Python file `face_recongnition.py` is the entry point.

Check help messages `-h` if you forget any flag usage.
```
$ python face_recongnition.py -h
Using TensorFlow backend.
usage: face_recongnition.py [-h] -t TRAIN -i TEST [-v VALIDATE]
                            [-m LEARNING_MODEL] [-n NUMBER_NEIGHBORS]
                            [-k KERNEL] [-b BOOSTING_ESTIMATORS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TRAIN, --train TRAIN
                        directory of training set/encodings of training set
  -i TEST, --test TEST  directory of testing set/encodings of testing set
  -v VALIDATE, --validate VALIDATE
                        directory of validating set/encoding of validating set
  -m LEARNING_MODEL, --learning-model LEARNING_MODEL
                        Use which model for learning: 1=knn, 2=decision tree,
                        3=boosting, 4=svm, 5=neural network (default: 5)
  -n NUMBER_NEIGHBORS, --number-neighbors NUMBER_NEIGHBORS
                        neighbor number for knn model (default: 8)
  -k KERNEL, --kernel KERNEL
                        kernel for svm model,
                        linear/poly/rbf/sigmoid/precomputed (default: rbf)
  -b BOOSTING_ESTIMATORS, --boosting-estimators BOOSTING_ESTIMATORS
                        the number of estimators for boosting (default: 10)
```
These flags are not all required, please use them respectively based on the algorithm you want to try.
The most important part is to assign algorithm the training set and testing set, by flags `-t` and `-i`. Some algorithms only accept encoding files, while the others accept raw data(inform with the directory).

The example excuting commands are listed below

### K-nearest neighbor

Use encoding files as input, add optional flag `-n` for assigning number of neighbors.
```
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 1 -t $TRAIN_ENCODINGS -i $TEST_ENCODINGS [-n number_of_neighbors]

//i.e.
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 1 -t pickle_files/pk_large.pickle -i pickle_files/pk_test.pickle

### Decision tree

Use encoding files as input. Pruning method is applied by default.
```
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 2 -t $TRAIN_ENCODINGS -i $TEST_ENCODINGS 

// i.e. 
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 2 -t pickle_files/pk_large.pickle -i pickle_files/pk_test.pickle

```
### Boosting 

Use encoding files as input. Optionally, you may set flag `-b` for the number of estimators used in boosting.
```
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 3 -t $TRAIN_ENCODINGS -i $TEST_ENCODINGS [-b number_of_estimators]

// i.e.
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 3 -t pickle_files/pk_large.pickle -i pickle_files/pk_test.pickle -b 40
Using TensorFlow backend.

### SVM

Use raw data directory as input. You can pick different kernal by flag `-k`. 

```
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 4 -t $DIRECTORY_TRAINING_IMAGES -i $DIRECTORY_TESTING_IMAGES [-k kernal_name]

// i.e. 
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 4 -t dataset/pk_dataset -i dataset/pk_dataset_test/

### Neural network

```
$ python face_recongnition.py -m 5 -t $DIRECTORY_TRAINING_IMAGES -i $DIRECTORY_TESTING_IMAGES
